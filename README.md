<p align="center">
  Welcome to the Snake Game! This is a simple and fun implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Pygame.
</p>

<h2>Features 🚀</h2>

1. **Snake Movement**: Control the snake using the arrow keys to eat the food and grow in size.

2. **Food**: 🍉 Neon pink food pieces appear on the screen for the snake to eat. Different types of food have varying point values.

3. **Score Display**: 📊 The game screen shows the player's current score, indicating the number of food pieces eaten.

4. **High Score**: 🏆 The game keeps track of the player's best score across multiple sessions.

5. **Level System**: 🎮 As the player's score increases, the game speed and difficulty level increase, offering a sense of progression.

6. **Countdown Timer**: ⏳ Each game round lasts for 30 seconds, adding a time-based challenge to the gameplay.

7. **Game Over Popup**: 💥 When the snake collides with itself, a popup window appears displaying "Game Over" along with buttons to "Try Again" or "Exit Game." Players can continue playing or exit the game as they like.

8. **Power-Ups (Optional)**: ⚡ You can add power-ups to the game, such as temporary speed boost or invincibility, to enhance the gaming experience further.

<h2>How to Play 🎮</h2>

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.

3. Run the `snake_game.py` script using Python:

python snake_game.py


4. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction (Up, Down, Left, Right).

5. Eat the neon pink food to increase your score and grow the snake.

6. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's body.

7. Try to achieve the highest score within the 30-second time limit.

8. When the game ends, a popup will display showing your score, high score, and options to try again or exit the game.

<h2>Customize the Game 🎨</h2>

You can further customize the game by tweaking the game constants such as window size, cell size, colors, countdown duration, and more in the `snake_game.py` file. Feel free to experiment and make the game uniquely yours!
